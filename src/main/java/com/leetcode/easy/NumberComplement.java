/**
 * <PRE>
 * Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:

    The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Example 2:

Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits),
 and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0
